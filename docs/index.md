## Qablet Learning Path

A Qablet timetable defines a financial product using a sequence of payments, choices and conditions. A valuation model implemented with a Qablet parser can value any contract, as long as the contract can be described using a Qablet Timetable.


This repositary contains a [learning path](https://github.com/qablet-academy/intro/tree/main/notebooks) based on notebooks to explain

- how to define contracts from basics, or using the `qablet_contracts` package.
- how to value contracts using models from the `qablet` package.
- how to view various stats from the model
- how to create custom Monte-Carlo models


## Contracts API

For the documentation of the specification language to define financial contracts see [qablet.github.io/qablet-contracts](https://qablet.github.io/qablet-contracts/).

## Model API

For the documentation of the models in the `qablet` package,

 - For the common elements, start with [Dataset](dataset.md)
 - For the model specific details see the **MODELS** section.
 - For viewing various stats see the **STATS** section.
