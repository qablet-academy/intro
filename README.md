## Qablet Learning Path

This repositary contains a [learning path](https://github.com/qablet-academy/intro/tree/main/notebooks) based on notebooks to explain

- how to define contracts from basics, or using the `qablet_contracts` package.
- how to value contracts using Monte-Carlo and Finite Difference models from the `qablet` package.
- how to view various stats from the model
- how to create custom Monte-Carlo models

Start with the [first notebook here](https://github.com/qablet-academy/intro/blob/main/notebooks/1_1_fixed_bond.ipynb).
